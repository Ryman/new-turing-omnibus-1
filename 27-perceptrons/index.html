      <p>
        This is a demonstration of some of the ideas from the Perceptrons
        chapter in the New Turing Omnibus. This animated scene is being viewed
        on a retina observed by some perceptrons. These perceptrons check
        whether the input pattern contains disjoint rectangles. If it does, this
        is shown in green.
