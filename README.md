## New Turing Omnibus

This repository contains some code examples created to help my understanding of
some of the concepts in the
[New Turing Omnibus](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0805071660/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0805071660&linkCode=as2&tag=computationclub-21).

This is in addition to the discussions that happen as part of the
[London Computation Club](http://london.computation.club/).
